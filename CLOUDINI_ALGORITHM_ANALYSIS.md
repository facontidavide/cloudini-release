# Cloudini V5 Algorithm Analysis

## Overview

Cloudini V5 is a two-stage pointcloud codec.

1. Stage 1 applies field-aware preprocessing to the point data.
2. Stage 2 optionally compresses each encoded chunk with LZ4 or ZSTD.

The default V5 target is lossy pointcloud compression with millimeter-scale
float quantization and adaptive integer encoding. V5 keeps the fast float path
separate from the adaptive integer machinery, because float-heavy clouds are
already dominated by the optimized lossy float encoder.

The current magic/version prefix is `CLOUDINI_V05`.

## When V5 Is Used

The V5 adaptive path is used only when all of these are true:

- `EncodingInfo::version >= 5`
- `encoding_opt == EncodingOptions::LOSSY`
- At least one non-leading integer field can use the V5 adaptive integer modes

Float-only lossy clouds bypass the V5 adaptive machinery and use the regular
field encoders directly. This avoids paying adaptive setup and buffering costs
when there is no integer field that can benefit from it.

## Chunking

Pointcloud payloads are encoded in fixed chunks of `32 * 1024` points. Each
chunk has:

- A Stage 1 byte stream.
- An optional Stage 2 compressed representation.
- A chunk-size prefix when Stage 2 compression is enabled.

Chunking bounds scratch memory, lets the compressor run on completed chunks,
and gives the decoder an exact expected point count for each chunk.

## Stage 1 Layout

Within each V5 chunk, Stage 1 writes:

1. Regular field streams in point order.
2. V5 adaptive integer sections, appended once per adaptive field.

Regular fields are fields that are not handled by V5 adaptive integer encoding.
This includes the leading lossy float vector, non-adaptive floats, `INT8`,
`UINT8`, and any unsupported field type handled by the existing compatible
encoders.

Adaptive integer fields are collected or streamed separately so their complete
per-field section can use the best local representation.

## Lossy Float Encoding

Lossy float fields with a resolution are quantized to integers:

```text
quantized = round(value / resolution)
delta = quantized - previous_quantized
encoded = zigzag_varint(delta)
```

For common pointcloud schemas, the first 3 or 4 consecutive `FLOAT32` fields
with resolutions are encoded by `FieldEncoderFloatN_Lossy`. This path uses SIMD
for quantization and delta generation, and it has a fast no-NaN path.

NaN is represented with the reserved varint marker `0`. Real encoded deltas are
shifted by one so the marker remains available.

Fields are often stored as floats but hold integers (`intensity`, `ring`) or
values on a coarse grid (a reflectance in 0.01 steps). Quantized at 1 mm, such a
field wastes about 10 bits per point. `RefineResolutionsToData()` (opt-in, per
cloud) replaces the resolution of these fields with the grid their values lie on:
1 for integers, which are then stored exactly, or `k * resolution` otherwise.
Readers need nothing new, since the resolution is in the header. `k * resolution`
is stored as a float and the decoder multiplies in the field's precision, so for
large values the coarser grid can decode further from the original: a second pass
decodes every value both ways and keeps it only if no value gets worse by more
than 0.1% of the resolution.

## Adaptive Integer Encoding

V5 adaptive integer encoding applies to these lossy-mode field types:

- `INT16`, `UINT16`
- `INT32`, `UINT32`
- `INT64`, `UINT64`

`INT8` and `UINT8` stay as raw byte copies. Their values are already one byte,
so adaptive varint or palette machinery would usually add overhead instead of
removing it.

Each adaptive integer field chooses one mode:

| Mode | Best For | Encoding |
|---|---|---|
| `DeltaVarint` | Smooth values with small deltas | Delta from previous value, then signed varint |
| `DeltaRle` | Repeated slopes or constant deltas | Runs of equal deltas, each as signed varint + run length |
| `Rle` | Repeated raw values | Raw value + run length |
| `Palette` | Low-cardinality fields | Unique raw values + bit-packed indexes |

### Mode Selection

For each adaptive integer field, V5 estimates the Stage 1 size of all adaptive
modes and picks the smallest one.

When Stage 2 compression is enabled, the smallest mode before compression is not
always the smallest after it. A palette stores every distinct value raw: for the
per-column timestamps of an organized scan (1024 distinct values per row) that
table barely compresses, while delta-varint turns the same data into small deltas
that repeat row after row. So, if the Stage 1 winner is not `DeltaVarint`,
the probe values are serialized in both modes and compressed with the configured
compressor, and the mode with the smaller compressed size is committed. This only
changes which (already supported) mode is written; decoders are unaffected.

- If the first chunk has more than `4096` points, V5 probes the first `4096`
  points, picks the mode, then streams the rest of the chunk using that mode.
- If the first chunk has `4096` points or fewer, V5 analyzes the whole chunk
  before writing the adaptive section.
- The selected mode is then reused for later chunks of the same pointcloud.

This keeps mode selection cheap and stable while still adapting to the field's
actual distribution.

### Committed Streaming

After a mode is committed, V5 does not store and rescan the whole chunk for
`DeltaVarint`, `DeltaRle`, or `Rle`. It builds the chosen section while walking
the input points, then appends that completed section after the regular field
stream.

`Palette` still needs the values for the chunk so it can build the unique-value
table and bit-packed indexes.

This preserves the V5 wire layout while removing avoidable per-chunk buffering
and second-pass work for the common non-palette modes.

## Stage 2 Compression

After Stage 1, each chunk can be passed through:

- `CompressionOption::NONE`
- `CompressionOption::LZ4`
- `CompressionOption::ZSTD`

The current benchmark default uses ZSTD level 1. The encoder can use a worker
thread and double buffering so one chunk can be compressed while the next chunk
is being encoded.

ZSTD contexts are reused per thread (`ZSTD_compressCCtx` / `ZSTD_decompressDCtx`)
instead of being created by every `ZSTD_compress` / `ZSTD_decompress` call.

For V5 chunks, the ZSTD frame ends a compressed block where each adaptive
section starts. ZSTD entropy-codes literals with one set of statistics per block,
so this keeps the statistics of the per-point stream and of each section apart.
The chunk is still a single standard ZSTD frame.

Scratch buffers are retained by capacity and are not zero-filled before each
chunk. Only the serialized byte range is passed to Stage 2.

## Decoding

Decoding reverses the chunk pipeline:

1. Parse the YAML or binary header.
2. For each chunk, optionally decompress Stage 2 into a reusable buffer.
3. Decode regular field streams point by point.
4. Decode each adaptive integer section into the correct output field offsets.

The decompression buffer keeps its capacity between chunks. The decoder returns
views sized to the actual decompressed chunk instead of shrinking the backing
storage after every chunk.

When a chunk has a single per-point decoder (the xyz / xyzi vector of float-only
clouds, or of V5 clouds whose other fields are all adaptive sections), the whole
chunk is decoded by one `FieldDecoder::decodePoints()` call. The float vector
decoder then reads varints without per-byte bounds checks while a longest-possible
point (`fields * kMaxVarintBytes` bytes) is still available, and falls back to the
checked path for the last points. Adaptive sections are decoded with a store of
fixed size (2, 4 or 8 bytes) and the same unchecked varint fast path.

## Benchmarking

Use `mcap_codec_benchmark` for local ratio and speed checks:

```bash
./build_release/tools/mcap_codec_benchmark DATA/<file>.mcap --max-messages 1000 --zstd --mode V5
```

Timing is benchmark-internal codec timing. Encode includes Cloudini Stage 1 and
optional Cloudini Stage 2 compression. Decode includes optional Cloudini Stage 2
decompression and Cloudini Stage 1 decode.

MCAP read/decompression time should not be interpreted as codec time.

## Validation Commands

```bash
cmake --build build_release --target mcap_codec_benchmark -j 8
ctest --test-dir build_release --output-on-failure -j 8
git diff --check
```

For decode-only profiling without MCAP read/decompression in the measured
region:

```bash
./build_release/tools/mcap_codec_benchmark DATA/<file>.mcap \
  --max-messages 1000 --zstd --mode V5 --decode-replay --decode-repeat 5
```

`--decode-replay` first reads and encodes samples, stores the encoded Cloudini
payloads in memory, and only then times repeated Cloudini decode operations.
