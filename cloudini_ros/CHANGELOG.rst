1.3.0 (2026-09-20)
------------------
* Fix license tags in package.xml
  According to ros_license_toolkit[^1] license tags should be in SPDX
  list of licenses. In case of claudini_ros, the license version was
  missing and in case of claudini_lib, the license name was not "exact".
  This commit changes the license tags to use SPDX license identifiers.
  Note that it doesn't fix the failures reported in claudini_lib in the
  output below:

1.2.2 (2026-06-04)
------------------
* build: synchronized version bump with cloudini_lib (MSVC support; no functional changes here)

1.2.1 (2026-05-20)
------------------
* ci(rolling): build point_cloud_interfaces from source via vcstool until the apt-sync drop is resolved

1.2.0 (2026-05-05)
------------------

1.1.0 (2026-04-20)
------------------
* feat(gorilla): Gorilla bit-packed XOR for FLOAT64 lossless (backward compatible) (`#93 <https://github.com/facontidavide/cloudini/issues/93>`_)
* Contributors: Davide Faconti

1.0.4 (2026-04-06)
------------------
* fix(ros): use ament_target_dependencies for pcl_conversions
  pcl_conversions 2.8.0 on Kilted switched from
  ament_export_include_directories to ament_export_targets, making
  ${pcl_conversions_INCLUDE_DIRS} empty and breaking the buildfarm.
  Use ament_target_dependencies which handles both old-style
  (INCLUDE_DIRS) and new-style (TARGETS) exports idiomatically.

1.0.1 (2026-03-01)
------------------

1.0.0 (2026-02-21)
-------------------
* feat: make topic_converter composable for component container usage
  Build topic_converter as a shared component library with
  rclcpp_components, while keeping the standalone executable via
  EXECUTABLE directive. Intra-process comms moved into constructor
  so it works in both standalone and component container modes.
* feat: add convenience API for compressing PointCloud2 directly (`#58 <https://github.com/facontidavide/cloudini/issues/58>`_)
  Add SerializeCompressedPointCloud2() and ConvertToRosPointCloud2() to allow
  users to compress sensor_msgs::msg::PointCloud2 without the topic_converter
  node. Includes test_direct_publisher example node and CLAUDE.md documentation.
  Also removes redundant PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS from test_cloudini_subscriber target.
* Fixed cmake issues and added some improvements (`#55 <https://github.com/facontidavide/cloudini/issues/55>`_)
* fix resolution profile not applied in ros_topic_converter (`#49 <https://github.com/facontidavide/cloudini/issues/49>`_)
